### CloudFront Fix: Origin Path & SPA Routing
- Cleared **Origin path** (was `/index.html`, which caused 403s for `/favicon.ico`, `/assets/*`)
- Set **Default root object** to `index.html`
- Added SPA fallbacks under **Error pages**:
  - 403 ‚Üí `/index.html` (HTTP 200, TTL 0)
  - 404 ‚Üí `/index.html` (HTTP 200, TTL 0)
- Created cache invalidation: `/*`
